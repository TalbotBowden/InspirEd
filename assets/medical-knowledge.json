Whitsett, Susan E. Wert, and Timothy E. Weaver Perinatal Institute, Section of Neonatology, Perinatal and Pulmonary Biology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center and University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, Ohio 45229 Jeffrey A. Whitsett: jeff.whitsett@cchmc.org; Susan E. Wert: susan.wert@cchmc.org; Timothy E. Weaver: tim.weaver@cchmc.org Abstract The alveolar region of the lung creates an extensive epithelial surface that mediates the transfer of oxygen and carbon dioxide required for respiration after birth. Maintenance of pulmonary function depends on the function of type II epithelial cells that synthesize and secrete pulmonary surfactant lipids and proteins, reducing the collapsing forces created at the air-liquid interface in the alveoli. Genetic and acquired disorders associated with the surfactant system cause both acute and chronic lung disease. Mutations in the ABCA3, SFTPA, SFTPB, SFTPC, SCL34A2, and TERT genes disrupt type II cell function and/or surfactant homeostasis, causing neonatal respiratory failure and chronic interstitial lung disease. Defects in GM-CSF receptor function disrupt surfactant clearance, causing pulmonary alveolar proteinosis. Abnormalities in the surfactant system and disruption of type II cell homeostasis underlie the pathogenesis of pulmonary disorders previously considered idiopathic, providing the basis for improved diagnosis and therapies of these rare lung diseases. NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript Keywords alveolar proteinosis; interstitial lung disease; respiratory distress syndrome; pulmonary fibrosis; pulmonary alveolar microlithiasis INTRODUCTION The respiratory tract consists of a remarkable, highly branched, tubular structure that leads to ~300 million alveolar sacs, creating an extensive surface area through which oxygen and carbon dioxide are exchanged in blood within alveolar capillaries. The alveolar surface is lined by type II and type I alveolar epithelial cells that are in direct contact with respiratory gases, creating collapsing forces at the air-liquid interface. To maintain inflation, these surface forces are mitigated by the presence of pulmonary surfactant (a mixture of proteins Copyright © 2010 by Annual Reviews.

Whitsett et al. Page 2 and lipids) that is synthesized and secreted onto the alveolar surface by type II epithelial cells. Because pulmonary surfactant reduces surface tension, it is critical for the maintenance of lung volumes during the respiratory cycle. Lack of pulmonary surfactant in preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome or adults with acute respiratory distress syndrome causes atelectasis leading to respiratory failure. The type II cell plays a critical role in surfactant production and in repair of the lung following injury, and it is the progenitor cell for type I epithelial cells, which comprise the majority of the gas-exchange region of the alveolus. It is increasingly clear that alterations in genes and processes affecting both type II cell homeostasis and surfactant function underlie the pathogenesis of a number of severe pulmonary diseases affecting infants, children, and adults, which, until very recently, were considered idiopathic. PULMONARY SURFACTANT Pulmonary surfactant is a complex mixture of lipids, mostly phosphatidylcholine (PC), and associated proteins. Four of these surfactant proteins, designated SP-A, SP-B, SP-C, and SP- D, play critical roles in various aspects of surfactant structure, function, and metabolism (1). All four are expressed at relatively high levels in type II cells and have distinct structures and functions. Alveolar surfactant takes on discrete physical forms, including the abundant, highly ordered material called tubular myelin as well as multilamellated and smaller, vesicular, protein-lipid structures that can be isolated from the lung. Surfactant forms are determined by the presence or absence of surfactant proteins and lipids, by the physical forces generated during the respiratory cycle, and by selective processes mediating uptake or degradation (Figure 1). Surfactant multilayers, derived from highly lamellated and tubular myelin forms, spread over the surface of the alveolus and reduce surface tension. Surfactant components are recycled by type II cells or catabolized by alveolar macrophages in a highly regulated system that maintains precise levels of pulmonary surfactant throughout life. Both surfactant lipids and proteins are synthesized primarily by type II cells. Surfactant lipids are stored in large, lipid-rich, intracellular organelles, termed lamellar bodies. Lamellar bodies are rich in the surfactant-associated phospholipids, PC and phosphatidylglycerol (PG), and in two low-molecular-weight, hydrophobic surfactant proteins, SP-B and SP-C, that are cosecreted with the surfactant lipids and interact closely with them (2). SP-B and SP-C alter lipid packing and spreading and enhance the surface tension-lowering activity of the lipids, as well as stabilizing the lipid layers during the respiratory cycle. The surfactant proteins SP-A and SP-D are larger, relatively abundant, oligomeric proteins that are also",

      "text": "lipids and proteins are synthesized primarily by type II cells. Surfactant lipids are stored in large, lipid-rich, intracellular organelles, termed lamellar bodies. Lamellar bodies are rich in the surfactant-associated phospholipids, PC and phosphatidylglycerol (PG), and in two low-molecular-weight, hydrophobic surfactant proteins, SP-B and SP-C, that are cosecreted with the surfactant lipids and interact closely with them (2). SP-B and SP-C alter lipid packing and spreading and enhance the surface tension-lowering activity of the lipids, as well as stabilizing the lipid layers during the respiratory cycle. The surfactant proteins SP-A and SP-D are larger, relatively abundant, oligomeric proteins that are also synthesized and secreted by type II cells. SP-D and SP-A are structurally related members of the collectin family of C-type mammalian lectins that share distinct collagen- like and globular, carbohydrate-binding domains. SP-A is required for the formation of tubular myelin and plays diverse roles in host-defense functions of the lung (3-5). SP-A binds lipopolysaccharides and various microbial pathogens, enhancing their clearance from the lung. Unlike SP-B and SP-C, SP-A does not play a critical role in surface functions, metabolism, or pulmonary surfactant under normal conditions. SP-D, however, influences the structural forms of pulmonary surfactant and is important in the regulation of alveolar surfactant pool sizes and reuptake (6–8). SP-D is also necessary in the suppression of NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript Annu Rev Med. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2014 August 11. Whitsett et al. Page 3 pulmonary inflammation and in host defense against viral, fungal, and bacterial pathogens (see References 3, 5 for review).Taken together, surfactant lipids and proteins play critical roles in (a) reducing surface tension in the alveolus, as required for ventilation, and (b) modulating various aspects of innate host defense of the lung against diverse pulmonary pathogens. GENETIC BASIS OF DISORDERS OF THE SURFACTANT SYSTEM Genetic causes of pulmonary disease related to the pulmonary surfactant system were first recognized in full-term infants who presented with severe respiratory failure and failed medical management, including surfactant replacement (see Reference 9 for review). Two major classes of surfactant system-related disorders have been recognized, those that cause disease by disrupting the functions of proteins critical for surfactant homeostasis and those that cause alveolar cell injury mediated by protein misfolding or toxic gain of function. Genetic disorders of surfactant homeostasis cause severe respiratory failure in the newborn period and interstitial lung disease (ILD) in older infants, children, and adults (Table 1). Histological diagnoses associated with these disorders include congenital alveolar proteinosis, desquamative interstitial pneumonitis, chronic pneumonitis of infancy, nonspecific interstitial pneumonitis, and usual interstitial pneumonitis (9). Diffuse alveolar diseases, including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) (10), and chronic pulmonary microlithiasis, have been associated, respectively, with mutations in SP-A (11) and the telomerase reverse transcriptase gene (TERT) (12, 13), in GM-CSF receptors (14, 15), and in the sodium/phosphate transport protein, SCL34A2 (16– 18). Genetic causes, presentations, and courses of these disorders are relatively distinct. Mutations in genes encoding SP-C (SFTPC), telomerase (TERT), and, most recently, SP-A (SFTPA) have been linked to familial interstitial pneumonia. These loci do not account for all familial forms of the disease; ILD is a significant component of other inherited disorders, such as Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome. Familial interstitial pneumonia accounts for ~2% of all interstitial pneumonias and is characterized by autosomal dominant inheritance with incomplete penetrance and early onset of disease relative to idiopathic forms (19). HEREDITARY SURFACTANT PROTEIN B (SP-B) DISORDERS Hereditary SP-B deficiency (OMIM #265120) is a relatively rare autosomal recessive disorder with a carrier rate estimated to be less than 1:2000 (20). Clinical Presentation Hereditary SP-B deficiency usually presents in full-term infants with unexplained respiratory distress and findings typical of respiratory distress syndrome in preterm infants, the latter lacking surfactant on a maturational basis (21). Infants may have a family history of unexplained neonatal death or consanguinity. Cyanosis and respiratory distress are usually noted in the first hours after birth, followed by respiratory failure that is refractory to surfactant replacement, ventilation, and other supportive care. Initial chest X-rays show diffuse opacification consistent with atelectasis. Respiratory failure is progressive, generally NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript Annu Rev Med. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2014 August 11. Whitsett et al. Page 4 leading to death within weeks to months of age despite assisted ventilation, oxygen, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Pathogenesis and Diagnosis The SFTPB gene is located on chromosome 2 (OMIM #178640). Hereditary SP-B deficiency has been linked to a number of distinct mutations in the SFTPB gene. These include deletion, termination, missense, and substitution mutations that interfere with the synthesis of proSP-B or produce an aberrant proSP-B protein that is not fully processed, leading to a loss of the active, mature SP-B peptide. Mature SP-B is a 79-amino-acid, amphipathic peptide that interacts closely with the surface",

Pathogenesis and Diagnosis The SFTPB gene is located on chromosome 2 (OMIM #178640). Hereditary SP-B deficiency has been linked to a number of distinct mutations in the SFTPB gene. These include deletion, termination, missense, and substitution mutations that interfere with the synthesis of proSP-B or produce an aberrant proSP-B protein that is not fully processed, leading to a loss of the active, mature SP-B peptide. Mature SP-B is a 79-amino-acid, amphipathic peptide that interacts closely with the surface of phosphatidylcholine-rich membranes in surfactant. The active peptide is produced by proteolytic processing of a 381- amino-acid proprotein during trafficking from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to multivesicular and lamellar bodies (2). A relatively common insertional mutation, 121ins2, causes the synthesis of an unstable mRNA with loss of synthesis of both proSP-B and SP-B peptides (9, 21). Neither proSP-B nor SP-B is detected in the lungs of patients bearing the 121ins2 mutation. In contrast, other SFTPB mutations result in the production of an incompletely processed proSP-B protein that is detected within the type II cells. In most forms of hereditary SP-B deficiency, the active SP-B peptide is absent in the surfactant isolated from alveolar wash or in the alveoli as assessed by immunohistochemistry (22). Consistent with the importance of SP-B in surfactant function, surfactant activity is deficient in material isolated from patients with this disorder. Histological findings in hereditary SP-B deficiency include (a) the accumulation of eosinophilic or periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)-positive, lipoproteinaceous material in the alveolar spaces, which often contain foamy alveolar macrophages; (b) hyperplastic alveolar epithelia with prominent type II cells; and (c) thickening of the alveolar septa, which is caused by proliferation of interstitial fibroblasts (Figure 2). At the ultrastructural level, type II cells lack lamellar bodies and contain large, atypical, multivesicular bodies, likely representing the failure of phospholipid membrane fusion during the packaging of surfactant lipids (Figure 2). Tubular myelin is absent, and abnormally processed proSP-C and SP-A accumulate with lipids in the alveolar spaces, providing a basis for the pathological diagnosis of congenital alveolar proteinosis. The alveoli are generally remodeled and lined by cuboidal type II cells, although this varies depending on the age of the infant and supportive care. Inflammation is also variable, generally consisting of foamy alveolar macrophages. Physiological, biochemical, and histological findings in lungs of patients with hereditary SP-B deficiency are consistent with those seen in Sftpb¯/¯ gene targeted mice, supporting the concept that the pathogenesis of lung dysfunction in this disorder is related primarily to the lack of SP-B in type II cells and in the alveolus (23). The diagnosis of hereditary SP-B deficiency, when suspected clinically and pathologically, is confirmed by the identification of mutations in the SFTPB gene. Because SP-B is required for both intracellular and extracellular aspects of surfactant homeostasis, the disease has not been treated successfully with surfactant replacement and supportive care. Survival has been extended by lung transplantation in a small number of infants with hereditary SP-B deficiency (24).

Page 5 HEREDITARY ATP-BINDING CASSETTE A3 (ABCA3) DISORDERS Mutations in the ABCA3 lipid transport protein cause a relatively rare autosomal recessive disorder that is presently the most common genetic cause of respiratory failure in full-term infants. Clinical Presentation Most infants with mutations in the ATP-binding cassette, subfamily A, member 3 (or ABCA3) gene (OMIM #610921) present with severe respiratory distress and cyanosis requiring ventilatory support in the immediate newborn period. The clinical findings are consistent with surfactant deficiency (25). Radiographic findings demonstrate diffuse alveolar disease and atelectasis. Respiratory failure occurs despite surfactant replacement and ventilatory support, and most infants die in the first months of life. Pathogenesis and Diagnosis The ABCA3 gene is located on chromosome 16 (OMIM #601615). ABCA3 deficiency is inherited as an autosomal recessive mutation, and >150 distinct mutations have been identified in association with severe neonatal lung disease. The vast majority of ABCA3 mutations cause neonatal lung disease and death within the first months of life. Less frequently, milder ABCA3 mutations (for example, E292V) are associated with chronic lung disease with features of ILD, desquamative interstitial pneumonitis, and nonspecific interstitial pneumonitis presenting in childhood (26, 27). The ABCA3 gene encodes a large, multiple-membrane-spanning polypeptide that is a member of the family of ABC transporters, which includes the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) and the multiple drug resistant transporter (MDR). Although the ABCA3 protein is expressed in many tissues, it is expressed highly in type II cells, where it is located at the limiting membranes of lamellar bodies (28, 29). ABCA3 mutations are associated with histological features of congenital alveolar proteinosis (25,",

The ABCA3 gene encodes a large, multiple-membrane-spanning polypeptide that is a member of the family of ABC transporters, which includes the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) and the multiple drug resistant transporter (MDR). Although the ABCA3 protein is expressed in many tissues, it is expressed highly in type II cells, where it is located at the limiting membranes of lamellar bodies (28, 29). ABCA3 mutations are associated with histological features of congenital alveolar proteinosis (25, 27). The respiratory epithelium undergoes cuboidal hyperplasia with remodeling and loss of alveoli, as well as accumulation of lipid-rich macrophages in the airspaces (Figure 2). Surfactant from patients with ABCA3-related lung disease is deficient in both PG and PC and has little surface activity (30). ABCA3 is located at the limiting membrane of lamellar bodies in alveolar type II cells, where it plays an important role in lipid transport, including both cholesterol and PC (29, 31). At the ultrastructural level, normal lamellar bodies are lacking in lungs of patients with ABCA3-related disease (25, 27). The presence of small intracellular organelles containing electron-dense material, likely representing lamellar bodies that lack appropriate lipid constituents, is useful in the tentative diagnosis of ABCA3-related disease (Figure 2). In general, the surfactant proteins A, B, C, and D are detected by immunohistochemistry in lung tissue from patients with lung disease caused by mutations in ABCA3. As in hereditary SP-B deficiency, the diagnosis of ABCA3-related disease is made by clinical and pathological findings supported by histological and ultrastructural studies. Definitive diagnosis is made by the identification of mutations in the ABCA3 gene locus. ABCA3-related lung disease is severe and usually results in death in the NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript Annu Rev Med. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2014 August 11. Whitsett et al. Page 6 first months of life. Life has been extended by lung transplantation in a number of patients with ABCA3 mutations (27, 30). HEREDITARY SP-C DISORDERS SP-C is a small, extremely hydrophobic peptide synthesized and secreted with surfactant lipid into the alveoli by type II alveolar cells. SP-C is produced from a precursor (proSP-C) encoded by the SFTPC gene. Mutations in SFTPC have been recently linked to familial and sporadic ILD (OMIM #610913). Clinical Presentation The index case was an infant who developed respiratory symptoms at six weeks of age and was diagnosed subsequently with interstitial pneumonitis (32). DNA sequence analysis of the SFTPC gene identified a mutation in a donor splice site (c.460 + 1G → A) of one allele that resulted in deletion of exon 4 and consequent loss of 37 amino acids in the C-terminal peptide of the proprotein (referred to as SP-C∆exon4). A separate SFTPC mutation (exon 5+128T→A) that results in substitution of glutamine for leucine (L188Q) was recently identified in two independent kindreds (33, 34). Family members exhibited variable onset of disease, from infancy to adulthood, with autosomal dominant inheritance and incomplete penetrance. Pathogenesis and Diagnosis The SFTPC gene is located in chromosome 8 (OMIM #178620). To date, approximately 40 missense, splice, or frameshift SFTPC mutations have been associated with familial or sporadic ILD. In general, SFTPC mutations are located in the brichos domain of proSPC, causing misfolding or aberrant processing of the precursor. Histological features of lung disease caused by mutations in the SFTPC gene include (a) diffuse alveolar damage of varying severity, (b) interstitial thickening with mild lymphocytic inflammation, (c) thickening of the alveolar septa, (d) accumulation of foamy alveolar macrophages and variable amounts of eosinophilic alveolar proteinosis material, and (e) regenerating alveolar epithelium lined by hyperplastic type II cells (Figure 2). Mutations that alter the ability of a protein to fold correctly result in retention of the unfolded/ misfolded protein in the ER(35, 36). Accumulation of unfolded or misfolded protein in the ER, a condition known as ER stress, induces an ER-to-nucleus signal pathway called the unfolded protein response, which increases transcription of chaperones that promote protein folding. In addition, translation of mRNA is attenuated, effectively slowing entry of newly synthesized protein into the ER and increasing the ratio of chaperone to unfolded protein. Proteins that fail to fold under these conditions are diverted to the ER- associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, in which misfolded protein is translocated to the cytosol for degradation by 26S proteasome. Failure to eliminate rapidly the terminally misfolded proteins can lead to formation of cytotoxic aggregates and/or trigger cell death pathways. Both SP-C∆exon4 and SP-CL188Q proproteins cause ER stress and readily aggregate when the ERAD pathway is compromised (37, 38).

Proteins that fail to fold under these conditions are diverted to the ER- associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, in which misfolded protein is translocated to the cytosol for degradation by 26S proteasome. Failure to eliminate rapidly the terminally misfolded proteins can lead to formation of cytotoxic aggregates and/or trigger cell death pathways. Both SP-C∆exon4 and SP-CL188Q proproteins cause ER stress and readily aggregate when the ERAD pathway is compromised (37, 38). NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript Annu Rev Med. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2014 August 11. Whitsett et al. Page 7 Targeted expression of SP-C∆exon4 in type II cells of transgenic mice resulted in dose- dependent cytotoxicity leading to disruption of lung morphogenesis and respiratory failure at birth (39). Importantly, lung dysmorphogenesis occurred in the presence of two wild-type Sftpc alleles, consistent with a toxic gain-of-function effect. This phenotype was not due to degradation and loss of mature SP-C peptide in the airspaces, since perinatal lung development and function were normal in Sftpc¯/¯ mice (40). Collectively, these results suggest that certain SFTPC mutations lead to irreversible misfolding of the SP-C proprotein and accumulation of misfolded protein that, in turn, leads to cell injury and death. This hypothesis is supported by the results of experiments confirming the cytotoxicity of mutant SP-C protein in cell culture (41, 42). The cytotoxic effect of mutant SP-C fits well with the emerging concept that epithelial cell injury and aberrant re-epithelialization are critical steps in the pathogenesis of ILD (43). What remains unclear is why the onset and severity of disease are so variable within a kindred. For example, in the L188Q kindred, the age of onset ranged from 4 months to 57 years, with histopathological findings ranging from non-specific interstitial pneumonitis in infants to usual interstitial pneumonitis in older patients (33). Phenotypic variability may be due in part to the influence of other genes, which render some patients more susceptible or resistant to disease, and in part to environmental stresses that may trigger or exacerbate disease. Interestingly, cells that stably expressed SP-C∆exon4 in culture adapted to chronic ER stress imposed by the mutant protein and grew normally; however, adaptation was accompanied by greatly increased susceptibility to viral-induced cell death (42). These findings provide a potential explanation for delayed onset of disease but have yet to be translated to an animal model. Two recent studies of IPF patients support a role for ER stress in pathogenesis. One study detected markers of ER stress and apoptosis in alveolar epithelial cells of IPF patients but not in those of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (44). The other study confirmed evidence of both ER stress and herpesvirus infection (45). Thus, ER stress may be a molecular pathway common to both familial and idiopathic forms of ILD. The precise roles of ER stress and environmental stress in the initiation and/or progression of ILD remain to be defined. HEREDITARY SP-A DISORDERS A recent study reported an association between two heterozygous mutations in the SFTPA2 gene (OMIM #178642) and familial pulmonary fibrosis that segregated with lung cancer (11). The results of preliminary studies suggested that the mutations caused misfolding and trapping of SP-A in the ER that could lead to loss of protein in the airspaces. Since Sftpa-/- mice have normal lung structure and function and do not develop ILD (46), it is possible that SFTPA2 mutations exert a toxic gain-of-function effect similar to SFTPC mutations. It remains unclear, however, if mutant SP-A actually induces ER stress, is degraded by ERAD, or forms cytotoxic aggregates.

Page 8 PULMONARY ALVEOLAR PROTEINOSIS Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) (OMIM #610910) is a rare disorder in which the alveoli become filled with surfactant lipids and proteins leading to progressive respiratory insufficiency (10, 47, 48). Clinical Presentation PAP is rarely diagnosed in childhood; it more commonly presents in adulthood in both acquired and secondary forms. Patients usually present with progressive dyspnea, exercise intolerance, and clubbing. Radiologic studies demonstrate diffuse alveolar opacities, termed “crazy-paving,\" but lack the fibrosis or remodeling associated with ILD (49). Alveolar wash or histologic assessment of lung biopsy demonstrates the accumulation of surfactant lipids and proteins and foamy alveolar macrophages in the lung. Surfactant lipids and proteins, including SP-A, SP-B, SP- C, and SP-D, accumulate in large quantities, and the material isolated from PAP patients maintains its surface-active properties. Thus, lung function and structure are generally well preserved. The pathological findings in acquired PAP are distinct from those in genetic pulmonary disorders related to SP-B, SP-C, or ABCA3, wherein surfactant is dysfunctional with resultant respiratory failure, pulmonary fibrosis and remodeling.

      "text": "histologic assessment of lung biopsy demonstrates the accumulation of surfactant lipids and proteins and foamy alveolar macrophages in the lung. Surfactant lipids and proteins, including SP-A, SP-B, SP- C, and SP-D, accumulate in large quantities, and the material isolated from PAP patients maintains its surface-active properties. Thus, lung function and structure are generally well preserved. The pathological findings in acquired PAP are distinct from those in genetic pulmonary disorders related to SP-B, SP-C, or ABCA3, wherein surfactant is dysfunctional with resultant respiratory failure, pulmonary fibrosis and remodeling. Pathogenesis and Diagnosis: Role of GM-CSF in Acquired PAP The critical role of GM-CSF signaling in the pathogenesis of PAP was first recognized from studies in transgenic mice lacking GM-CSF (50, 51) or the common ẞ-chain of the GM-CSF receptor (52). Both of these mouse models developed severe PAP with features virtually identical to those in human patients with acquired PAP. The mouse models demonstrated that the disorder was related to the inability of alveolar macrophages to clear or metabolize surfactant lipids and proteins. Replacement of GM-CSF in the lung rapidly restored alveolar macrophage differentiation and surfactant clearance, correcting the PAP (53, 54). The recognition that most adult patients with acquired PAP have high circulating levels of anti- GM-CSF autoantibodies provided a critical link between the mouse studies and the clinical disorder (55). Thus, it has been established that GM-CSF plays a critical, nonredundant role in the regulation of differentiated functions of the alveolar macrophage in the lung. Its absence results in failure to degrade surfactant components, leading to the progressive accumulation of normal lipids and proteins in the lung (56, 57). Because alveoli are well preserved in PAP, lung function can be restored by physical removal of the excess surfactant using alveolar wash or by treatment with GM-CSF using lung aerosol or systemic administration. Role of GM-CSF Receptors in Hereditary PAP GM-CSF activity requires signaling via the dimerization of its receptors, consisting of an a- chain and common ẞ-chain that activate JAK/STAT5 signaling to enhance macrophage differentiation and function. Dysfunction of the common ẞ-chain of the GM-CSF receptor (OMIM #300770) has been associated with PAP (58). Recently, mutations in the a-chain of the GM-CSF receptor (OMIM #306250) were implicated in the pathogenesis of PAP (14, NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript Annu Rev Med. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2014 August 11. Whitsett et al. Page 9 15). A number of patients with PAP related to mutations in the a-chain of the GM-CSF receptor have now been identified, usually presenting with signs and symptoms in childhood. Clinical and histopathological features are similar to those of acquired PAP, although these patients usually present at earlier ages (Figure 2). The diagnosis of hereditary PAP is supported by clinical, pathological, and radiological findings. The definitive diagnosis can now be made by the identification of mutations in the genes encoding the GM-CSF receptors. Since some of the GM-CSF a-chain mutations retain residual activity, it is expected that some patients will respond to treatment with additional GM-CSF. PAP caused by mutation in the common ẞ-chain in mice was rescued by bone marrow transplantation (59), providing support for the feasibility of future cell- based therapies for refractory PAP in patients with defects in GM-CSF signaling. HEREDITARY PULMONARY ALVEOLAR MICROLITHIASIS Hereditary pulmonary alveolar microlithiasis (SCL34A2; OMIM #265100) is a rare autosomal disorder causing diffuse alveolar disease in which calcified, crystalline microliths are observed throughout the airspaces. The disease is transmitted as an autosomal recessive disorder, generally presenting in middle age with progressive respiratory deterioration. Dense, diffuse, reticulonodular densities are seen on CT scanning (60). More than 600 cases of pulmonary alveolar microlithiasis have been reported (61), and recent genome-wide studies demonstrate its linkage to a sodium-phosphate cotransport protein, SCL34A2 (OMIM #604217). SCL34A2 is a sodium-dependent phosphate transporter that is highly expressed in type II cells in the lung (62, 63). The precise pathogenesis of this disorder, leading to the accumulation of calcium phosphate crystals in the alveolus, has been proposed to be related to the degradation of surfactant phospholipids and the release of phosphate into the alveolus, which, in turn, must be cleared from the lung by transport via SCL34A2. A number of mutations have been identified in the SCL34A2 gene, including missense, frameshift, gene termination, amino acid substitutions, and promoter deletions (16–18). Although the disorder generally presents with pulmonary symptoms, testicular microlithiasis, a cause of male sterility, has also been associated with mutations in SCL34A2 (16). The diagnosis of pulmonary microlithiasis is made by clinical and radiologic criteria, and the definitive diagnosis can now be made by the identification of mutations in the SCL34A2 gene. PULMONARY FIBROSIS ASSOCIATED WITH DEFECTS IN TELOMERASE Heterozygous mutations in genes encoding two essential components of telomerase, TERT (OMIM #187270) and telomerase RNA component (TERC, OMIM #602322), are also associated",

      "text": "identified in the SCL34A2 gene, including missense, frameshift, gene termination, amino acid substitutions, and promoter deletions (16–18). Although the disorder generally presents with pulmonary symptoms, testicular microlithiasis, a cause of male sterility, has also been associated with mutations in SCL34A2 (16). The diagnosis of pulmonary microlithiasis is made by clinical and radiologic criteria, and the definitive diagnosis can now be made by the identification of mutations in the SCL34A2 gene. PULMONARY FIBROSIS ASSOCIATED WITH DEFECTS IN TELOMERASE Heterozygous mutations in genes encoding two essential components of telomerase, TERT (OMIM #187270) and telomerase RNA component (TERC, OMIM #602322), are also associated with pulmonary fibrosis (12, 13). Telomerase activity is elevated in proliferating cells, and loss of activity results in telomere shortening that can trigger cell death pathways. Telomere shortening has also been detected in IPF patients without mutations in telomerase (64). Thus, it is likely that pathogenesis is related to telomere shortening rather than to mutations in the telomerase genes. The current view is that telomere shortening leads to loss of epithelial cells during a critical window of reepithelialization that, in turn, drives a fibrotic response (Figure 1).

Both proteins are encoded by single genes, located on human chromosomes 2 and 8 respectively, which have been characterized and extensively studied. Mutations in the SP-B gene have been shown to cause severe lung disease, and polymorphisms in the SP-B gene may be associated with the development of RDS in premature infants. In contrast, mutations in the SP-C gene have not yet been identified or shown to cause lung disease, although given the apparent importance of SP-C in surfactant function, this remains a possibility. © 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

Introduction Pulmonary surfactant is the mixture of lipids and specific proteins needed to reduce alveolar surface tension and prevent end-expiratory collapse. An in- ability to produce sufficient amounts of surfactant due to pulmonary immaturity is the principal cause of the respiratory distress syndrome observed in in- fants born prematurely [1]. Pulmonary surfactant contains at least four distinct specific proteins which have been identified to date. These include SP-A and SP-D, which are larger, hydrophilic proteins, and two smaller, extremely hydrophobic proteins, called SP-B and SP-C. The hydrophobic proteins appear to be critical for surfactant's ability to lower surface tension by enhancing adsorption and spreading of surfactant phospholipid to the air-liquid interface [2]. Both SP-B and SP-C are important components of mammalian derived exogenous surfactant prepa- rations used to treat infants with RDS such as Sur- vanta, Curosurf, and Infasurf. The importance of SP-B in normal surfactant function is indicated by the observations that infants or experimental animals unable to produce SP-B develop lethal neonatal res- piratory disease [3], and polymorphisms in the SP-B gene were observed more frequently in infants with RDS than in a control population [4]. Similar abnor- malities in the SP-C gene have not yet been observed. This review will focus on the contribution of varia- tions in the SP-B and SP-C genes and their estab- lished and potential roles in causing lung disease. 2. Surfactant protein B SP-B is encoded on a single gene located on the short arm on human chromosome 2, and has been mapped by in situ hybridization to 2p12→2p11.2 [5]. The complete human, as well as murine, and rabbit sequences, have been characterized [6]. It is a rela- tively small gene, spanning approximately 9500 bases. It is comprised of 11 exons, of which the 11th exon is untranslated. The organization of the murine and rabbit genes are similar in terms of the number of exons, and relative size, although the overall size of the gene is somewhat smaller in both the mouse and rabbit due to the shorter size of sev- eral introns. The production of SP-B is lung specific, and within the lung its expression is limited to non- ciliated bronchiolar epithelial cells (Clara cells) and alveolar type II cells. Although SP-B was the second surfactant associated protein to be described, the name of the SP-B locus is referred to as sftp3. The 5' flanking region of the SP-B gene has been extensively characterized, and contains sequences that are important in conferring cell and tissue spe- cificity of expression [7]. Proximal (nucleotides -80 to -110) and more distal (-331 to -439) cis-acting elements that interact with the transcription factors TTF-1 and members of the HNF-3 family have been identified that appear to be particularly important for SP-B expression [8,9]. Additional sequences in this region with both non-specific and cell specific, and positive and negative effects on SP-B gene tran- scription, have",

The 5' flanking region of the SP-B gene has been extensively characterized, and contains sequences that are important in conferring cell and tissue spe- cificity of expression [7]. Proximal (nucleotides -80 to -110) and more distal (-331 to -439) cis-acting elements that interact with the transcription factors TTF-1 and members of the HNF-3 family have been identified that appear to be particularly important for SP-B expression [8,9]. Additional sequences in this region with both non-specific and cell specific, and positive and negative effects on SP-B gene tran- scription, have been identified [10]. The SP-B gene is transcribed into a 2000 base mRNA, which directs the synthesis of a 381 amino acid preproprotein. A 23 amino acid signal peptide, encoded in the first exon, is removed co-translation- ally. The resulting proprotein undergoes proteolysis in at least two distinct steps to yield the mature 79 amino acid, 8700 Da protein found in the airspa- ces [7]. Mature SP-B is encoded in exons 6 and 7 of the SP-B gene. The first proteolytic processing step removes the aminoterminal portion of the propro- tein, whereas the second removes the carboxytermi- nal portion (Fig. 1). These latter processing steps are specific to alveolar type II cells [11]. The enzymes and the genes responsible for these processing steps have not yet been identified. The protein sequences of mature porcine and bovine SP-B have been di- rectly determined [12,13], along with deduced amino acid sequences determined from cDNA sequences from a number of species [6,14], and are highly con- 325 L.M.

The disease was first recognized in 1993 in a family in which three full- term infants died from lung disease of neonatal on- set. Both parents and three siblings were free of pul- monary symptoms suggesting an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance [3]. In all three affected infants, SP-B protein was undetectable in lung tissue by im- munologic methods, while SP-A and the precursor protein of SP-C were present in amounts comparable to those in control tissues. SP-B mRNA was also undetectable by Northern blot analysis, supporting the hypothesis that the primary cause of disease was an inability to produce SP-B. SP-B deficiency was established as the cause of disease when the af- fected infants were shown to be homozygous for a frameshift mutation in exon 4 of the SP-B gene that accounted for the lack of SP-B protein [15]. Since the initial description of the disorder, more than 35 families with infants affected by hereditary SP-B deficiency have been identified (L. Nogee, un- published observation). Affected infants have gener- ally been born at or near term, and developed severe respiratory symptoms shortly after birth. The pre- senting clinical signs and symptoms are those of sur- factant deficiency, including tachypnea, grunting, flaring, retractions and need for supplemental oxy- gen. Pulmonary hypertension is a frequent compo- nent of the clinical picture, and it is not uncommon for SP-B deficient infants to be treated with extra- corporeal life support when available. The radio- graphic appearance most often resembles that of RDS in premature infants, although some affected infants have not had prominent infiltrates on chest radiographs early on in the course of the illness, and some have had more of an interstitial rather than alveolar pattern. The clinical diagnosis most often ascribed to such infants has been RDS, although affected infants have been thought to have persistent pulmonary hypertension, presumed sepsis with neg- 326 L.M. Nogee / Biochimica et Biophysica Acta 1408 (1998) 323-333 ative blood cultures, meconium aspiration syndrome, and transient tachypnea of the newborn. The hy- poxic respiratory failure in SP-B deficient infants is severe and progressive, and almost all affected in- fants have been treated with mechanical ventilation, and often with high frequency ventilation. Affected infants may transiently improve following treatment with exogenous surfactant preparations containing SP-B, but the response is not sustained. Repeated doses (almost 80) were ineffective in preventing respiratory failure and death in an antenatally diagnosed infant in whom surfactant replacement therapy",

The hy- poxic respiratory failure in SP-B deficient infants is severe and progressive, and almost all affected in- fants have been treated with mechanical ventilation, and often with high frequency ventilation. Affected infants may transiently improve following treatment with exogenous surfactant preparations containing SP-B, but the response is not sustained. Repeated doses (almost 80) were ineffective in preventing respiratory failure and death in an antenatally diagnosed infant in whom surfactant replacement therapy was initiated at birth [16]. Variable im- provement has been seen in some children with corticosteroid therapy [17]. The disease is ultimately fatal, although with aggressive supportive therapy SP-B deficient infants may survive for many months. The costs of caring for these children are high, both in economic terms and for the stresses imposed on the family. 3.2. Pathology and pathophysiology The lung pathology of SP-B deficient infants is variable. The predominant findings are often non- specific changes due to lung injury, including alveo- lar cell hyperplasia and interstitial fibrosis [3,18]. One particularly striking finding on histopathologic ex- amination of the lung tissue of many SP-B deficient infants is the accumulation of granular, eosinophilic material that stains positively with periodic acid- Schiff reagent filling distal air spaces. Foamy macro- phages and desquamated alveolar cells are also ob- served trapped in the alveolar material. This appear- ance has been referred to as alveolar proteinosis, because of the similarity in appearance to that of adults and older children with this disorder. The na- ture of the proteinosis material is different, in that it lacks SP-B, whereas the alveolar proteinosis material in older children or adults contains abundant SP-B, as well as SP-A, SP-C, and surfactant phospholipid. The amount of proteinaceous material observed is variable and may be minimal in some cases. It is unknown whether the variability in the amount of proteinaceous material is related to effects of treat- ment, such as mode of ventilation or surfactant ther- apy, duration of survival, or natural biologic varia- bility of the disease. Additionally, mechanisms other than SP-B deficiency can result in the histopatholog- ical picture of alveolar proteinosis. Mice in whom the genes for granulocyte macrophage colony stimu- lating factor (GM-CSF) or its receptor were inacti- vated developed these histopathologic findings [19,20], and a deficiency of a component of the GM-CSF receptor has recently been implicated in the pathogenesis of alveolar proteinosis in human infants [21], indicating that other genetic mechanisms can produce similar pathology. Thus the term 'he- reditary SP-B deficiency' more accurately describes infants genetically unable to produce SP-B, rather than the term 'congenital alveolar proteinosis', which may result from mechanisms other than SP-B defi- ciency. The incidence of SP-B deficiency is unknown, although the disease appears to be quite rare. A dis- proportionate number of families have had more than one child affected with this recessive disorder, suggesting that in the absence of a family history of neonatal respiratory disease cases have gone unrec- ognized. The extent of phenotypic variation is also unknown. The report of an infant with unexplained chronic lung disease associated with reduced produc- tion of SP-B supports the notion that milder forms of the disease may be observed [17]. Experimental animals in whom antibodies directed against mature SP-B were instilled intratracheally de- veloped severe lung disease, supporting the role of the mature peptide in normal lung function [22,23]. However, the pathophysiology of SP-B deficiency ap- pears to be more complicated than simply related to the lack of the mature protein. Unexpectedly, a num- ber of secondary alterations in the content and me- tabolism of other surfactant components have been observed in SP-B deficient infants, suggesting addi- tional roles for SP-B or its precursor protein in sur- factant metabolism. The lung tissue of all SP-B deficient infants studied to date contains abundant 6000 to 12000 Da pepti- des that are strongly immunoreactive with antisera directed against the SP-C proprotein. These peptides are secreted into the lung fluid, and result in intense immunohistochemical staining of the proteinaceous material with anti-proSP-C antisera. Using antisera directed against different epitopes of the SP-C pro- protein, Vorbroker et al. concluded that these pep- tides contain the aminoterminal portion of the 327 L.M. Nogee / Biochimica et Biophysica Acta 1408 (1998) 323-333 proSP-C molecule, and likely result from incomplete processing of the proprotein [24]. The mechanism whereby the lack of SP-B inter- feres with SP-C processing remain unknown. Possi- ble mechanisms could include a direct role for SP-B, or proSP-B or one of its domains in the proteolysis of proSP-C. Another possibility may relate to other secondary abnormalities within the type II cell. Ul- trastructural analysis of the lung tissue of SP-B defi- cient",

Nogee / Biochimica et Biophysica Acta 1408 (1998) 323-333 proSP-C molecule, and likely result from incomplete processing of the proprotein [24]. The mechanism whereby the lack of SP-B inter- feres with SP-C processing remain unknown. Possi- ble mechanisms could include a direct role for SP-B, or proSP-B or one of its domains in the proteolysis of proSP-C. Another possibility may relate to other secondary abnormalities within the type II cell. Ul- trastructural analysis of the lung tissue of SP-B defi- cient infants revealed reduced numbers of and poorly formed lamellar bodies, the intracellular storage or- ganelles of surfactant [25]. As the final processing steps of SP-C take place in a distal cellular compart- ment (multivesicular bodies or lamellar bodies), the lack of the processing organelle could lead to disrup- tion of SP-C processing. Abnormalities in surfactant phospholipids have also been observed in SP-B deficient infants. Amni- otic fluid analyses from two affected infants demon- strated very abnormal phospholipid profiles at term, with lecithin:sphingomyelin ratios of <1.0 (normal > 2.0 at 38 weeks gestation), and an absence of phos- phatidylglycerol [16,26]. Phosphatidylglycerol was also markedly reduced in the lung fluid and tissue of infants who underwent lung transplantation [26]. SP-A metabolism may also be altered in the absence of SP-B. While the total amount of SP-A in lung fluid and tissue did not differ markedly from that of controls, immunohistochemical staining for SP-A in lung tissue of deficient infants demonstrated in- tense staining of the extracellular proteinaceous ma- terial, however epithelial cell staining for SP-A stain- ing was sparse compared that of control lung tissues [18]. The functional significance of alterations in SP- A metabolism remains unknown. The proteinaceous material that accumulates in the airspaces of SP-B deficient infants thus contains abundant amounts of SP-A and aberrant SP-C, and a relative paucity of surfactant phospholipid. Mature SP-C protein was not detected in lung or amniotic fluid from SP-B deficient infants [24]. Thus the respiratory failure in SP-B deficient infants may result not only from the lack of SP-B, but pos- sibly from the lack of SP-C, the accumulation of non-surface active proteins, and derangement of type II cell intracellular metabolism. The mechanisms underlying these secondary changes in surfactant me- tabolism remain to be elucidated. One hypothesis is that SP-B, or other domains of proSP-B, may be necessary for the proper formation of lamellar bodies. In the absence of the proper development of this intracellular organelle, surfactant phospholi- pid and proteins cannot be packaged properly. Clar- ification of the mechanisms involved in derangement of surfactant metabolism in SP-B deficiency should provide insights into type II cell function. 3.3. Genetics of SP-B deficiency The common mutation responsible for SP-B defi- ciency involves a substitution of GAA for C in co- don 121, a net 2 base pair insertion that causes a frameshift, and premature signal for the termination of translation, accounting for the lack of SP-B pro- tein [15]. This mutation, termed 121ins2, has ac- counted for approximately 2/3 of the mutant alleles identified to date. It has been found principally in families of Northern European, Anglo-Saxon, and Scottish-Irish descent. However affected infants have been identified in other ethnic groups, including families of Middle Eastern, Mediterrean, and Asian descent. It is not known whether the common muta- tion resulted from a founder effect, or due to a mech- anism causing a recurrent de novo mutation at the same site. While the exact population frequency of the 121ins2 mutation is also unknown, it appears to be low. Thus identification of this mutation in pa- tients with clinical features of SP-B deficiency can be useful diagnostically [26]. Two other mutations have been described, both of which result in only a single amino acid change, and allow for production of proSP-B [17,27]. Clinical disease associated with pro- duction of abnormal SP-B peptides is possible. Other mechanisms that could result in SP-B deficiency, which have not yet been observed, include deletions or rearrangements of the SP-B gene, mutations in sequences important for SP-B gene regulation, or mutations in other genes encoding proteins needed for SP-B gene transcription. As proSP-B undergoes proteolytic processing to yield the mature peptide, mutations in the gene needed for SP-B processing could also potentially result in disease. 3.4. Treatment Treatment options for SP-B deficient infants re- 328 L.M. Nogee / Biochimica et Biophysica Acta 1408 (1998) 323-333 main limited. The disease is invariably fatal, and currently the only available treatment options for SP-B deficient infants are provision of compassionate care for the infant and family, or lung transplanta- tion. Experience with lung transplantation for SP-B deficiency has been reported in three infants [26]. One infant died of adenoviral infection shortly after the procedure, however",

Treatment Treatment options for SP-B deficient infants re- 328 L.M. Nogee / Biochimica et Biophysica Acta 1408 (1998) 323-333 main limited. The disease is invariably fatal, and currently the only available treatment options for SP-B deficient infants are provision of compassionate care for the infant and family, or lung transplanta- tion. Experience with lung transplantation for SP-B deficiency has been reported in three infants [26]. One infant died of adenoviral infection shortly after the procedure, however two others have had encour- aging short-term results. Experience with lung trans- plantation in infants is limited however, and the long-term outlook for these children is unknown. It is unlikely that protein replacement with the mature peptide would be sufficient to adequately treat the disease. SP-B replacement by administration of mul- tiple (>80) doses of exogenous surfactants contain- ing bovine SP-B was attempted in an antenatally diagnosed SP-B deficient infant beginning at birth [13]. While this child's initial lung disease was less severe than that of a previous sibling, his lung dis- ease still progressed and he died awaiting lung trans- plantation. Post-mortem analysis of the lung tissue did not exhibit alveolar staining for SP-B suggesting that the exogenously administered SP-B was not in- corporated intracellularly. Multinucleated giant cells within granulomata that stained positively for SP-B were observed in lung tissue, suggesting that the exo- genously administered SP-B was not metabolized normally. Additionally, the defect in SP-C processing was not corrected. It is possible that the amounts of SP-B used to treat this infant were insufficient, or that there was toxicity due to the other surfactant components administered. Purified preparations of SP-B for aerosolization or intratracheal administra- tion are not available. It is likely however that intra- cellular synthesis of SP-B will be necessary to correct the metabolic alterations in surfactant processing within the type II cell. This consideration, along with the tissue specificity of SP-B expression, the rapidly fatal nature of the disease, and lack of treat- ment alternatives, make SP-B deficiency an impor- tant disease model for gene therapy in the lung. Pre- liminary experience with viral vectors capable of directing SP-B synthesis in tissue culture and exper- imental animals has been reported, but considerably more work needs to be done before they are ready for clinical use [28-30]. 3.5. Animal models of SP-B deficiency Clark and colleagues developed SP-B 'knock-out' mice by targeted disruption of the SP-B gene [31]. Homozygous SP-B deficient mice lacked SP-B specif- ic mRNA and protein, and did not expand their lungs and died within minutes of birth. This mouse model resembles the human disease in that SP-C is also not processed appropriately, and lamellar body formation is disrupted. These animals provide an in- valuable tool for studying the pathophysiology of the disease, and for studying potential therapeutic op- tions. Akinbi and colleagues generated a transgenic mouse line who carried an SP-B gene construct which encoded the aminoterminal portion and ma- ture SP-B peptide, but lacked the carboxyterminal portion of proSP-B, under the control of the SP-C promoter [32]. These mice expressed SP-B from the transgene, and were crossbred with mice heterozy- gous for the disrupted SP-B allele to eventually ob- tain mice that expressed SP-B only from transgene in the null background. These animals survived, indi- cating that they could be rescued by reconstituting SP-B expression. Additionally, these experiments in- dicate that the carboxyterminal portion of proSP-B is not essential for survival. 4. SP-B gene polymorphisms and respiratory distress syndrome In addition to the mutations in the SP-B gene as- sociated with acute respiratory failure in full-term infants, a number of polymorphisms have been iden- tified in the SP-B gene. One coding polymorphism at the end of exon 4 has been recognized, although not commented on, in previous reports [6]. One allele encodes isoleucine at codon 131, the other threonine. The substitution of isoleucine for threonine would abolish a consensus signal for N-linked glycosylation at this site. It is unlikely that glycosylation at this location is essential, as this glycosylation site is not present in other mammalian species [14]. The distri- bution of these two alleles in the population is not known, nor whether either allele could predispose to or possibly be associated with disease. 329 L.M. Nogee / Biochimica et Biophysica Acta 1408 (1998) 323-333 A highly polymorphic region containing a variable nucleotide tandem repeat (VNTR) sequence is lo- cated within intron 4 of the SP-B gene. The variation in the size of these repeats accounts for a previously recognized SP-B restriction fragment length poly- morphism (RFLP) for BamH1 [5]. The different al- leles due to variations in this region have been ex- tensively characterized by Floros and coworkers [4]. At",

Nogee / Biochimica et Biophysica Acta 1408 (1998) 323-333 A highly polymorphic region containing a variable nucleotide tandem repeat (VNTR) sequence is lo- cated within intron 4 of the SP-B gene. The variation in the size of these repeats accounts for a previously recognized SP-B restriction fragment length poly- morphism (RFLP) for BamH1 [5]. The different al- leles due to variations in this region have been ex- tensively characterized by Floros and coworkers [4]. At least 12 different alleles have been identified, each containing a variable number (from 3 to 18) of mo- tifs consisting of a conserved 20 bp element followed by a variable length of (CA)n repeats. Differences in the distribution of alleles in different ethnic groups were observed. The most common allele contains 11 motifs, and accounted for 90% of the alleles in Cau- casian individuals, but for a lesser percentage in Afri- can-Americans (75%) and Nigerian (83%) individu- als. The second most common allele (5%) in the Caucasian group had five motifs deleted, whereas insertions of motifs were more common in the Afri- can-American and Nigerian groups [33]. The functional significance of these small intronic insertions and deletions is unknown. Floros et al. examined the association of SP-B alleles that differed at this locus with the development of RDS in pre- mature infants. They found that 32% of infants with RDS had a polymorphism (either insertion or dele- tion of extra motifs as opposed to the most com- monly observed allele), whereas only 9.5% of the control group had a polymorphism [4]. However, the RDS infants were significantly more premature in terms of their gestational age, a known risk factor for RDS, so that the association could also be re- lated to prematurity. In a subsequent study, the fre- quency of an SP-B polymorphism at this locus in combination with an SP-A gene polymorphism, was significantly higher in babies with RDS than in a control group comparable for gestational age and ethnic background [34]. The mechanism(s) whereby these polymorphisms could be associated with disease remain unclear, as this type of polymorphic variation is not one that would obviously affect SP-B regulation. It is possible that the polymorphic markers could be linked to abnormalities elsewhere in the gene affecting SP-B production or processing, although the association was with having any polymorphism, and not a par- ticular allele. Individuals who are carriers for SP-B deficiency, and who have one allele incapable of pro- ducing SP-B, have in general not had histories of pulmonary disease, although systematic studies ex- amining pulmonary function in such individuals have not been performed. Interestingly, mice hetero- zygous for one abnormal SP-B allele developed air trapping as adults [35], suggesting that having one abnormal SP-B allele may be a risk factor for the development of lung disease. Finally, the recent re- port of an infant with a mutation on one allele re- sulting in a single amino acid substitution, and one apparently normal allele, who initially had undetect- able SP-B levels in his lung fluid, but whose SP-B levels increased as his lung disease improved [27], also supports the notion that one abnormal allele could be associated with lung disease in some cir- cumstances. 5. Surfactant protein C Human SP-C is encoded by a single gene located on the short arm of chromosome 8, centromeric to 8p23.1, and the locus is referred to as sftp2 [36]. It is a fairly small gene, spanning only 3500 bases. The gene contains six exons and five introns; the last exon is untranslated [37]. The SP-C gene is located in close proximity to the gene for bone morphoge- netic protein-1 (BMP-1), whose transcription initia- tion site is located only 706 bases downstream of the polyadenylation site of the SP-C gene [38]. The gene is transcribed into a 0.86 kb mRNA, which directs the synthesis of a 22000 Da proprotein. Alternative splicing at the beginning of exon 5 leads to two different transcripts, which differ by 18 bases in length [37]. The resulting proproteins thus differ by six amino acids. The functional significance of this alternative splicing is unknown. The proprotein is further proteolytically processed to yield the ex- tremely hydrophobic 35 amino acid SP-C protein found in the airspaces (Fig. 2). The DNA sequence from which the mature SP-C peptide is derived is located in exon 2. Two cysteine residues contained in the mature SP-C peptide are posttranslation- ally palmitoylated, and SP-C is thus a proteolipid [39]. The enzymes involved in the posttranslational processing of proSP-C to mature SP-C have not been characterized. The structure and properties of 330 L.M.

      "text": "this alternative splicing is unknown. The proprotein is further proteolytically processed to yield the ex- tremely hydrophobic 35 amino acid SP-C protein found in the airspaces (Fig. 2). The DNA sequence from which the mature SP-C peptide is derived is located in exon 2. Two cysteine residues contained in the mature SP-C peptide are posttranslation- ally palmitoylated, and SP-C is thus a proteolipid [39]. The enzymes involved in the posttranslational processing of proSP-C to mature SP-C have not been characterized. The structure and properties of 330 L.M. Nogee / Biochimica et Biophysica Acta 1408 (1998) 323-333 SP-C are reviewed by Johansson elsewhere in this issue. The SP-C gene promoter contains sequences di- recting lung specificity and cell specificity to the dis- tal respiratory epithelium, and SP-C expression is restricted to alveolar type II cells in human lung. A 3.7 kb portion of the sequence 5' to the SP-C gene has been used extensively to target a number of transgenes to the distal respiratory epithelium in mice [40]. The initial characterization of the SP-C gene re- vealed two groups of clones which differed consider- ably in their DNA sequences at multiple locations, including single nucleotide substitutions, insertions, and deletions, primarily in intronic sequences [37]. Southern blot analysis however, was consistent with a single SP-C gene [36], and the observed sequence differences were thus likely due to different SP-C alleles. Variations in SP-C cDNA sequences had been observed previously, including coding sequence changes at codons 138 (Asn or Thr) and codon 186 (Asn or Ser) [41]. It is not known whether these variants have any correlation with disease. While the SP-C gene sequences that have been reported to date differ considerably from one another, the extent of allelic variation and distribution of different SP-C alleles in the general population remain unknown. A single base deletion in intron 5 creates an EcoR1 RFLP, and a highly polymorphic (CA)n repeat re- gion is located in close proximity to the SP-C gene (within the first intron of the BMP-1 gene) [38]. These polymorphic markers may be useful in studies attempting to link the SP-C gene with disease. To date, variations in the SP-C gene have not been associated with human disease. Hatzis et al. exam- ined SP-C mRNA expression as assessed by in situ hybridization in eight infants who died from RDS and ten control infants who died from other causes [42]. They found similar levels of SP-C mRNA ex- pression in both groups, and concluded that altered SP-C expression due to pretranslational mechanisms was unlikely to contribute to the pathogenesis of RDS. They also found that the SP-C gene sequences from four healthy adults without lung disease of dif- ferent ethnic backgrounds (two Caucasian, two Ni- gerian), and from two premature Caucasian infants with RDS, did not differ from one another, although differences from previously reported sequences were Fig. 2. SP-C gene, mRNA, proprotein and processing. Exons and translated portions of the mRNA are represented by boxes; introns and untranslated portions are represented by lines. The positions of a coding polymorphism in exon 5 and an EcoR1 RFLP are shown. Amino acids corresponding to the beginning and end of mature SP-C and the polymorphism are indicated by their single let- ter abbreviation. The proposed block that occurs in SP-C processing in the absence of SP-B is indicated by a dashed line. 331 L.M. Nogee / Biochimica et Biophysica Acta 1408 (1998) 323-333 observed. SP-C protein expression was not examined in this study. In contrast, in a recent preliminary report, Wert et al. observed markedly decreased staining for proSP-C in the lungs of 15 full-term infants who died from respiratory distress syndrome [43]. In three instances, more than one infant born to the same parents was affected, suggesting a genetic basis for their disease, although no SP-C gene muta- tions were identified in this study. These observations support a role for SP-C or proSP-C in the patho- genesis of some infants with neonatal respiratory failure. It is not known whether specific mutations in the SP-C gene result in respiratory disease. Such muta- tions have not yet been reported, nor has targeted disruption of the SP-C gene in experimental animals been reported. However, given the small size of the SP-C gene, such mutations may be quite rare. It is possible that SP-C's role in surfactant and/or type II cell function may not be essential, with SP-B or other proteins able to compensate for a lack of SP-C, and that mutations in the SP-C gene will not cause res- piratory disease. Alternatively, it may be that SP-C gene mutations could be lethal prenatally rather than causing lung disease postnatally, although this would be surprising given the restriction of SP-C expression to the distal respiratory epithelium. 6.

      "text": "size of the SP-C gene, such mutations may be quite rare. It is possible that SP-C's role in surfactant and/or type II cell function may not be essential, with SP-B or other proteins able to compensate for a lack of SP-C, and that mutations in the SP-C gene will not cause res- piratory disease. Alternatively, it may be that SP-C gene mutations could be lethal prenatally rather than causing lung disease postnatally, although this would be surprising given the restriction of SP-C expression to the distal respiratory epithelium. 6. Future directions Much remains to be learned concerning the role of mutations and polymorphisms in the SB-B and SP-C genes and their contribution to human lung disease. The recognition of hereditary SP-B deficiency as a cause of lung disease has raised additional questions. The incidence of the disease remains to be deter- mined. The mechanisms whereby the lack of SP-B disrupts other aspects of surfactant metabolism need to be elucidated. Better treatment options need to be developed, and the disease is an important model for gene therapy in the lung. Finally the con- tribution of more subtle mutations and polymor- phisms in the SP-B (and possibly SP-C) gene(s) to the development of other lung diseases (such as chronic lung disease and recovery from lung injury) deserves more investigation.

The activity of surfactant at the alveoli involves three main processes: (i) transfer of surface active molecules from the aqueous hypophase into the interface, (ii) surface tension reduction to values close to 0 mN/m during compression at expiration and (iii) re-extension of the surface active film upon expansion at inspiration. Phospholipids are the main surface active components of pulmonary surfactant, but the dynamic behaviour of phospholipids along the breathing cycle requires the necessary participation of some specific surfactant associated proteins. The present review summarizes the current knowledge on the structure, disposition and lipid-protein interactions of the hydrophobic surfactant proteins SP-B and SP-C, the two main actors participating in the surface properties of pulmonary surfactant. Some of the methodologies currently used to evaluate the surface activity of the proteins in lipid-protein surfactant preparations are also revised. Working models for the potential molecular mechanism of SP-B and SP-C are finally discussed. SP-B might act in surfactant as a sort of amphipathic tag, directing the lipid-protein complexes to insert and re-insert very efficiently into the air-liquid interface along successive breathing cycles. SP-C could be essential to maintain association of lipid-protein complexes with the interface at the highest compressed states, at the end of exhalation. The understanding of the mechanisms of action of these proteins is critical to approach the design and development of new clinical surfactant preparations for therapeutical applications. ©2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Introduction** Pulmonary surfactant is a complex mixture of lipids and proteins whose main function is to reduce the sur- face tension at the alveolar air-liquid interface of lungs in order to avoid alveolar collapse at the end of expiration and to facilitate the work of breathing. This proteo- lipidic material is synthesized by type II pneumocytes, one of the cell types forming the alveolar epithelium, and follows a regulated exocytic pathway leading to secretion into the thin aqueous layer covering the alve- oli. Pulmonary surfactant is absolutely required for lung breathing. The lack, deficiency or inactivation of this essential material is the cause of severe respiratory disor- ders, sometimes lethal, such as the Neonatal Respiratory Distress Syndrome (NRDS) (Hallman et al., 2001), or the pulmonary dysfunction associated with the Acute Res- piratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), a disease related with different processes as injury, inflammation or sepsis (Seeger et al., 1993). Supplementation of the imma- ture lungs of preterm babies with exogenous surfactants has dramatically improved clinical prognosis of these patients; however, the clinical management of ARDS is still under development (Gunther et al., 2001; Marraro, 2004; Medford, 2004). In this particular case it is of great importance to overcome the inhibitory effects on surfac- tant due to inflammation processes. Although animal- derived surfactants have been proven to improve clinical outcome of infants at risk for or having Respiratory Dis- tress Syndrome (RDS), difficulties regarding large-scale production, suspension techniques, reproducibility and purity of natural surfactants limit their clinical useful- ness. Therefore, a completely defined “humanized\" lung surfactant mixture would be preferable. The develop- ment of efficient surfactant preparations",

      "text": "of these patients; however, the clinical management of ARDS is still under development (Gunther et al., 2001; Marraro, 2004; Medford, 2004). In this particular case it is of great importance to overcome the inhibitory effects on surfac- tant due to inflammation processes. Although animal- derived surfactants have been proven to improve clinical outcome of infants at risk for or having Respiratory Dis- tress Syndrome (RDS), difficulties regarding large-scale production, suspension techniques, reproducibility and purity of natural surfactants limit their clinical useful- ness. Therefore, a completely defined “humanized\" lung surfactant mixture would be preferable. The develop- ment of efficient surfactant preparations for therapeutic practices is a main challenge within this area of investiga- tion, but the design and production of this kind of prepa- rations require an extensive knowledge of the molecular mechanisms governing the processes occurring at the respiratory surface. **2. Pulmonary surfactant: composition and function** Although the composition of pulmonary surfactant can vary from one species to another, or even from indi- viduals within the same species, the major fraction of pulmonary surfactant in all organisms is constituted by the lipids. Thus, surfactant is formed by about 90% of lipids, most of them phospholipids, and 8–10% of pro- teins. The lipid composition of pulmonary surfactant of different species was reviewed by Veldhuizen et al. (1998). In general terms, mammalian surfactants are composed of approximately 80% (weight of total mate- rial) of phosphatidylcholine (PC), about half of which is dipalmitoylphosphatydilcholine (DPPC). There are some exceptions, as the very recently discovered low DPPC content (~15%) in surfactant from some het- erothermic mammals, which spend a significant period of time in torpor (Lang et al., 2005). The remaining PC is composed primarily of molecular species con- taining monoenoic and dienoic fatty acids sterifying the sn-2 position of the glycerol backbone. The acidic phospholipids, phosphatidylglycerol (PG) and phos- phatidylinositol (PI), account for 8–15% of the total surfactant phospholipid pool. In general, when PI lev- els are higher, PG content is lower. Surfactant from fetal lungs usually contains higher levels of PI but this is generally reverted in adult life. Except for the human, phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) is low (3-5%) and the other phospholipids are present at very low lev- els. Concerning neutral lipids, cholesterol is the major component, accounting for up to 8-10% of surfac- tant by weight, which means up to as much as 20% cholesterol/phospholipid ratio in a molar basis. Small amounts of mono-, di- and tri-acylglycerol have been also reported, as well as some free fatty acids, mainly palmitate. Overall, the most remarkable characteristic of surfactant composition when compared with other mammalian membranes is the unusual high content in DPPC and anionic phospholipids (PG plus PI). Nev- ertheless, as pointed out in a very recent study from Lang et al. (2005) where the phospholipid composition of surfactant from different mammals has been com- pared, a “consensus” well-defined surfactant phospho- lipid composition cannot be probably invoked. Rather, surfactant from each animal species is likely unique and has been evolutionarily optimized for particu- lar conditions of development, respiratory rate, body temperature, etc., being probably further modified by individual pathophysiological situations such as dis- --- 107 A.G. Serrano, J. Pérez-Gil / Chemistry and Physics of Lipids 141 (2006) 105–118 eases, activity regime or other environmental or genetic factors. The protein moiety of surfactant comprises four specific surfactant-associated proteins (Haagsman and Diemel, 2001). They can be classified in two groups, the hydrophilic surfactant proteins SP-A and SP-D, and the hydrophobic surfactant proteins SP-B and SP-C. SP-A is the major protein in surfactant representing about 5-6% of its dry weight and is isolated in strong association with surfactant phospholipids and hydrophobic proteins. SP-D, however, does not appear associated with the lipid- containing structures and it accounts only for ~0.5% of the material obtained from lung lavage fluid. Both SP- A and SP-D belong to the collectin family of proteins. They are multimeric proteins with collagen-like domains and globular calcium-dependent carbohydrate-binding domains. These structural characteristics provide them the ability to bind many different ligands as calcium, sugars or lipid molecules in a concerted manner, and made them appropriate to play an important role in the innate immune system (Crouch and Wright, 2001). SP- A and SP-D have the ability to bind to a broad spectrum of pathogens including bacteria, viruses and fungi. The innate host defense activities in which these surfactant proteins participate at the alveolar airspaces are essential to maintain the sterile condition of the respiratory sur- face. Human lungs contain about 300 million alveoli of 75–300 µm in diameter, which means an area of approx- imately 70 m² in contact with the external medium and fully exposed to microorganisms. As a matter of fact, knock-out mice engineered to specifically deactivate the expression of SP-A or SP-D manifest significantly higher susceptibility to infections than wild-type animals,",

      "text": "the ability to bind to a broad spectrum of pathogens including bacteria, viruses and fungi. The innate host defense activities in which these surfactant proteins participate at the alveolar airspaces are essential to maintain the sterile condition of the respiratory sur- face. Human lungs contain about 300 million alveoli of 75–300 µm in diameter, which means an area of approx- imately 70 m² in contact with the external medium and fully exposed to microorganisms. As a matter of fact, knock-out mice engineered to specifically deactivate the expression of SP-A or SP-D manifest significantly higher susceptibility to infections than wild-type animals, but no apparent respiratory dysfunction (LeVine et al., 1997; Wert et al., 2000; McCormack and Whitsett, 2002). In addition to its role in the innate immune response, SP- A has been somehow related to the surface activity of surfactant. The presence of SP-A is necessary for the formation of tubular myelin, considered one of the pos- sible structural intermediates in surface film formation, which enhances surfactant adsorption but is not essen- tial for normal breathing in in vivo models (Korfhagen et al., 1996). It has been also shown that SP-A has a synergistic effect in the enhancement of lipid interfacial adsorption promoted by SP-B and SP-C (Schürch et al., 1992; Bi et al., 2001; Possmayer et al., 2001), although a direct role of the hydrophilic surfactant collectins in interfacial film formation and/or surface tension reduc- tion at the alveoli has not been proposed so far. Therefore, these proteins will not be further discussed in the present review. For more detailed information on SP-A and SP- D structure-function relationships, the reader is referred to other articles (for a review see Sano and Kuroki, 2005). The other two proteins in surfactant are SP-B and SP- C. These are very small hydrophobic polypeptides result- ing from the proteolytic processing of larger precursors along the exocytic pathway of pulmonary surfactant in type II pneumocytes. Each of them accounts for no more than 1-1.5% of total surfactant weight but in spite of their relatively low abundance, they play critical roles in for- mation and stabilization of pulmonary surfactant films (Weaver and Conkright, 2001). The importance of SP-B in surfactant is apparent from the lethal respiratory dis- tress that is caused by SP-B deficiency in humans (Klein et al., 1998) and in SP-B knock-out mice (Clark et al., 1995; Tokieda et al., 1997). On the other hand, targeted deletion of the SP-C gene (SP-C-/-) in mice leads to the development of severe progressive pneumonitis within a shorter or longer period of time after birth, depending on the genetic background (Glasser et al., 2001, 2003). It is important to note that the absence of SP-B in trans- genic mice (SP-B¯/¯) is accompanied by an incomplete processing of SP-C precursor protein leading to an addi- tional deficiency of mature SP-C in alveolar airspaces (Clark et al., 1995; Vorbroker et al., 1995; Weaver and Conkright, 2001), so that the independent roles of each protein cannot be unequivocally established. With regard to this, a conditional model where the temporary loss of SP-B in adult mice resulted in surfactant dysfunction and respiratory failure in spite of maintenance of SP-C and surfactant lipid composition has been recently devel- oped (Ikegami et al., 2005). Thus, this model confirmed a critical role of SP-B in adult lung function. The activity of pulmonary surfactant at the alveolar spaces involves three main processes that have to be optimized for a proper surface behaviour (Fig. 1): (i) transference of surface active material from the aqueous EXPIRATION 2. GOOD COMPRESSIBILITY (very low surface tension during compression) 1. VERY RAPID INTERFACIAL ADSORPTION INSPIRATION 3. VERY EFFICIENT REEXTENSION Fig. 1. Main activities of pulmonary surfactant complexes during the compression-expansion breathing cycling at the respiratory air-liquid interface. --- 108 A.G. Serrano, J. Pérez-Gil / Chemistry and Physics of Lipids 141 (2006) 105–118 hypophase close to the interface followed by interfacial adsorption of the active molecules to form the surface active film, (ii) surface tension reduction to values close to 0 mN/m during the compression of the respiratory sur- face that occurs at expiration and (iii) re-spreading of the surface film during expansion at inspiration. It is widely assumed that the surfactant components directly implicated in the surface tension reduction are the phospholipids. However, none of the phospholipid components can behave as a good surfactant by itself. For instance, a pure DPPC monolayer has been shown to attain surface tensions values close to 0 mN/m upon com- pression (Nag et al., 1999; Cruz et al., 2000; Wustneck et al., 2005), but the rate of adsorption of this phos- pholipid from the hypophase to the air-liquid inter- face is extremely slow (Cruz et al., 1997, 2000). Con- versely, phospholipids with good adsorption and spread- ing properties do not produce low enough surface tension",

      "text": "components directly implicated in the surface tension reduction are the phospholipids. However, none of the phospholipid components can behave as a good surfactant by itself. For instance, a pure DPPC monolayer has been shown to attain surface tensions values close to 0 mN/m upon com- pression (Nag et al., 1999; Cruz et al., 2000; Wustneck et al., 2005), but the rate of adsorption of this phos- pholipid from the hypophase to the air-liquid inter- face is extremely slow (Cruz et al., 1997, 2000). Con- versely, phospholipids with good adsorption and spread- ing properties do not produce low enough surface tension when their monolayers are subjected to compression (Takamoto et al., 2001). There is no question that the presence of the proteins, particularly hydrophobic pro- teins, is absolutely required for suitable efficiency of a given material as a surface tension reducing agent under conditions mimicking compression-expansion cycles of breathing. In addition to the in vivo evidences for SP- B and SP-C requirement, in vitro studies have clearly demonstrated that interfacial adsorption, film stability and re-spreading capacities are three critical properties that cannot be fully achieved by a strictly lipidic prepa- ration (Halliday, 1996). The conclusion is, therefore, that the mixture of lipids and proteins has been evo- lutionary optimized in pulmonary surfactant to exhibit simultaneously these three properties. The experimen- tal data collected to date suggest that the proteins would be mainly involved in promoting adsorption, stabiliza- tion and re-spreading of the surface film, while the lipids would be essentially responsible for the maximal surface tension reduction upon compression. In the present review, the structure, lipid-protein interactions and surface activity properties of SP-B and SP-C will be discussed in detail and related to the current models on the molecular mechanisms of their participa- tion in the respiratory function. **3. From the secretory pathway to the air-liquid interface: technical approaches** Surfactant lipids and proteins are synthesized and secreted by type II pneumocytes. The exocytic pathway goes from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the lamel- lar bodies (LB), the specialized organelles where all lipids and proteins are assembled and stored in densely Type II LB TM LB-like particle Air Subphase Fig. 2. Structure of pulmonary surfactant at the alveolar airspaces. Epithelial type II pneumocytes synthesize and store pulmonary sur- factant in the form of compact arrays of bilayers in the lamellar bodies (LB). Upon secretion, some of these LBs maintain their packed struc- ture in the form of LB-like particles, and some of them are unpacked to form tubular myelin (TM), an ordered structure of crossing bilayers. LB-like particles and TM are highly surface active intermediates able to insert very efficiently surface active phospholipids into the air-liquid interface. packed concentric lamellar structures. Secretion takes place via fusion of these surfactant containing vesicles with the plasma membrane and leads to the formation of a new highly ordered lipid–protein structure, specific of this membranous system, called tubular myelin (TM) (Fig. 2). Under transmission electron microscopy TM has a unique architecture consisting of crossing bilayers forming square lattices. This structure can be repro- duced in vitro in the presence of SP-A, SP-B, DPPC, PG and calcium (Suzuki et al., 1989; Williams et al., 1991; Poulain et al., 1992). SP-A seems to be placed at the cor- ners of the lattices (Palaniyar et al., 1999). Although not strictly required for normal lung function, TM is consid- ered a precursor form of the interfacial film. It has been proposed that it is a highly adsorptive intermediate of surfactant material because of the very efficient interfa- cial adsorption of surfactant preparations containing this structure (Williams, 1992). However, the absence of TM in SP-A knock-out mice does not alter breathing func- tion (Korfhagen et al., 1996), suggesting that there might be alternative mechanisms for surfactant transfer to the interface, in such a way that tubular myelin might be an enhancer rather than an essential element in this process. Thus, in vivo, the formation of the interfacial film comes from the adsorption of lipid-protein complexes from highly organized macromolecular structures and trough mechanisms that are still not well understood. Recent studies have shown that LB-like particles maintain after secretion much of their packed structure, which is able to transfer the lipid/protein material directly into the inter- face in a very efficient and cooperative manner (Haller et al., 2004). Such almost instantaneous interfacial con- version is dependent on surface tension, indicating that the architecture of lipid-protein complexes in LBs may be particularly well suited to respond to surface forces. Once the interfacial surfactant film is formed at the first --- 109 A.G. Serrano, J. Pérez-Gil / Chemistry and Physics of Lipids 141 (2006) 105–118 air inspiration of the newborn, it will be stable under the dynamic compression-expansion cycles of breath- ing along the entire life. At present, it is widely accepted that",

Such almost instantaneous interfacial con- version is dependent on surface tension, indicating that the architecture of lipid-protein complexes in LBs may be particularly well suited to respond to surface forces. Once the interfacial surfactant film is formed at the first --- 109 A.G. Serrano, J. Pérez-Gil / Chemistry and Physics of Lipids 141 (2006) 105–118 air inspiration of the newborn, it will be stable under the dynamic compression-expansion cycles of breath- ing along the entire life. At present, it is widely accepted that there is a reservoir of surfactant attached to the inter- face, which plays an important role in the maintenance of the required stability of such a film. This reservoir, likely composed of multiple tightly packed membranes, keeps enough new and recycled material in close proximity to the interface in order to facilitate the squeeze-out and re-insertion of surface active components under cycling, that is, ensuring the proper renewal of the surface film. In fact, multilayered structures consistent with this model have been already visualized by transmission electron microscopy and can be also detected by fluorescence and (a) Wilhelmy plate Interfacial adsorption ELECTROBALANCE y = Surface tension II = Surface pressure Π = γ (water) – γ (sample) SURFACTANT scanning force microscopies (von Nahmen et al., 1997; Schurch et al., 1998; Piknova et al., 2001). So, after secre- tion, alveolar forms of surfactant include LBs and LB- like particles, TM and the interfacial film itself consisting of the surface monolayer plus the additional multilayered reservoir located underneath. These three-dimensional structures constitute a highly complex network of mem- branes within the small space comprised between the surface of the epithelial cells and the air-liquid interface (represented in Fig. 2). In vitro, different biophysical techniques (Fig. 3) try to mimic the situation occurring in the alveoli in order to elucidate the molecular mechanisms governing the three principal processes involved in surfactant activity: (b) ELECTROBALANCE Langmuir-Wilhelmy surface Compression Expansion 88888888 π(m N/m) 60 40 20 (c) Sample (ա/Nա) II 0 Subphase 20 40 60 80 100 Àrea/molécule (A2) DPPC + SP-B Langmuir- Blodgett films transfered to mica Atomic Force Microscopy supports 10000000 Stirrer Time (sec) Pulsating Bubble Surfactometer Capillary (d) Captive Bubble Surfactometer (e) Imaging system Piston Bubble Agar Bubble Buffer/Suspension Buffer/Suspension of surfactant material of surfactant material Stirrer Inverted interface brightfield cover slip cells LBP air-liquid interface Obj.

(e) The recent development of the so-called inverted interface microscope allows correlation of changes in surface tension with the structural transformations produced by surfactant complexes at the interface, as observed by fluorescence microscopy (taken from Bertocci et al., 2005, with permission). --- 110 A.G. Serrano, J. Pérez-Gil / Chemistry and Physics of Lipids 141 (2006) 105–118 interfacial adsorption, surface tension reduction and film re-spreading. Interfacial adsorption kinetics can be followed using a Whilhelmy dipping plate attached to an electro-balance suited to monitor changes in surface tension (Fig. 3a). The hypophase is usually contained in a small trough with a fixed area and a lateral perforation permitting the injection of surface material into the subphase without perturbing the interface. The progressive incorporation of the injected material into the air-liquid interface leads to changes in surface tension that can be registered as a function of time. One main limitation is that, in vitro, the rate of interfacial adsorption is usually measured at much lower concentration of surface active material in the hypophase than that probably occurring in vivo. For the study of spread films of different composi- tions, one of the oldest but still most used devices is the Langmuir-Wilhelmy surface balance (Fig. 3b). As designed by Clements (1957) for his initial seminal stud- ies on surfactant, it consists of a trough containing the aqueous hypophase whose surface area can be varied, and a Wilhelmy dipping plate attached to an electro- balance. This balance is particularly suited for studying spread",

      "text": "that, in vitro, the rate of interfacial adsorption is usually measured at much lower concentration of surface active material in the hypophase than that probably occurring in vivo. For the study of spread films of different composi- tions, one of the oldest but still most used devices is the Langmuir-Wilhelmy surface balance (Fig. 3b). As designed by Clements (1957) for his initial seminal stud- ies on surfactant, it consists of a trough containing the aqueous hypophase whose surface area can be varied, and a Wilhelmy dipping plate attached to an electro- balance. This balance is particularly suited for studying spread films because precise amounts of surface active material can be deposited at the interface. Changes in the surface area permit to mimic the compression-expansion cycles of breathing but in a relatively static way that does not reflect the dynamic process of breathing. One of the most important advantages of this technique is that radiography and epifluorescence microscopy of the surface film can be easily performed using labeled pro- teins or lipids (Nag et al., 1997; Plasencia et al., 2005; Yan et al., 2005). This enables visualization of lipid and lipid-protein domains as well as the study of the lateral distribution of the membrane-associated proteins at the air-liquid interface. In addition, monolayers prepared with this kind of balances can be transferred onto mica supports for scanning force microscopy analysis (von Nahmen et al., 1997; Diemel et al., 2002; Bernardino de la Serna et al., 2004; Cruz et al., 2004). This technique is providing in the recent years important complementary information on film topology avoiding the use of extrin- sic probes. This matter is of interest, as recent investiga- tions have shown that even small traces of fluorescently labeled lipids such as NBD-PC could produce significant perturbations, especially at the nanometer scale, that are analyzable only by comparing scanning force and epi- fluorescence microscopy images (Cruz et al., 2005). A pioneer technique developed by Enhorning in 1977 to analyze pulmonary surfactant dynamics is the pulsat- ing bubble surfactometer (Fig. 3c). It consists of a sample microchamber connected to the atmosphere by a small capillary. An air bubble attached to this capillary is pul- sated by varying the pressure inside the sample cuvette as a way to mimic the compression-expansion breath- ing cycles of an alveolus. Surface tension is calculated from the Law of Young and Laplace (P = 2 × y/r, where P is the pressure across the bubble, y the surface tension and r is the radius of the bubble or “artificial alveolus\"). The surface tension at maximum bubble radius is indica- tive of surfactant adsorption during surface expansion, while y at minimum radius indicates the film's ability to reduce surface tension during compression. The pulsat- ing bubble surfactometer has been extremely useful for monitoring the quality of pulmonary surfactant samples relative to their biological activity (Gunther et al., 1999; Brackenbury et al., 2002; Merrill et al., 2004), and has become very popular in clinical research, but it is not very accurate for mechanistic studies because of leakage of material through the capillary. At present this technique is falling in disuse in favor of the captive bubble surfac- tometer (Fig. 3d), which avoids the problem of leakage and mimics dynamic natural breathing frequencies. This model system was introduced by Schurch et al. in 1989 and later modified by Putz et al. (1994). It consists of an air bubble floating against an agar gel in an airtight chamber. The surface tension at the bubble surface is calculated from the shape of the bubble that can be mon- itored by a video camera (Schoel et al., 1994). Unlike the pulsating bubble surfactometer, the subphase in a captive bubble experiment can be stirred and spread films can be prepared only requiring few nanograms of proteins. However, the main disadvantage of this technique is that it is time-consuming. The difficulty of calculations from the video images was an important inconvenient at the beginning, but today this problem has been fully over- come by a proper software development. More recently a new noninvasive optical technique has been developed to measure surface tension in a miniaturized air-liquid interface (Bertocchi et al., 2005). The designers of the method have called it “inverted interface\" (Fig. 3e). It is based on a sapphire cone with 300 µm aperture, which relies on surface coher- ence to keep the liquid sample in a fixed and almost planar position above the objective of an inverted micro- scope. The radius of curvature of the fluid meniscus is related to the surface tension and produces a char- acteristic pattern of back-reflection upon illumination. This novel method allows observation of pulmonary sur- factant transformations as it comes into contact with the air-liquid interface, and their correlation with the decrease on surface tension. However, changes in surface",

It is based on a sapphire cone with 300 µm aperture, which relies on surface coher- ence to keep the liquid sample in a fixed and almost planar position above the objective of an inverted micro- scope. The radius of curvature of the fluid meniscus is related to the surface tension and produces a char- acteristic pattern of back-reflection upon illumination. This novel method allows observation of pulmonary sur- factant transformations as it comes into contact with the air-liquid interface, and their correlation with the decrease on surface tension. However, changes in surface tension can only be followed at this inverted interface down to a certain value, therefore preventing the analy- --- 111 A.G. Serrano, J.

Pulmonary hydrophobic surfactant proteins: the keys of surface activity in the lungs** 4.1. SP-B: an amphipathic tag to the interface The only indispensable protein, among pulmonary surfactant proteins, to initiate air breathing, SP-B, is a small hydrophobic polypeptide of 79 amino acids. It is synthesized as a longer precursor (381 amino acids), which undergoes proteolytic cleavage of N- and C- terminal propeptides in at least three different steps, to give rise to the mature sequence (Brasch et al., 2003; Ueno et al., 2004). In type II pneumocytes SP-B pro- cessing occurs along the exocytic pathway of surfactant, and it is not completed until assembled in LB together with the other lipids and proteins (Voorhout et al., 1992; Korimilli et al., 2000). Mature SP-B is isolated from animal lung lavages as a homodimer containing three intramolecular disul- phide bonds per monomer and an additional disulphide (a) stabilizing the dimer. These covalent linkages have been shown to constrain the protein flexibility without signif- icantly perturbing its activity in in vitro studies (Serrano et al., 2005). The exact three-dimensional structure of SP-B is still unknown. There are abundant experimental data obtained from indirect techniques such us circu- lar dichroism (Andersson et al., 1995), infrared spec- troscopy (Vandenbussche et al., 1992; Pastrana-Rios et al., 1995), spin resonance (Perez-Gil et al., 1995) or flu- orescence anisotropy (Baatz et al., 1990), that provide a good picture of the conformation and disposition of the polypeptide, either in solvents or in membrane environ- ments. Also, sequence alignments reveal that the location of the Cys residues in SP-B is a common feature among a group of proteins referred to as the saposin-like proteins (SAPLIP) (Munford et al., 1995). All members of this family are membrane-interacting proteins and they are supposed to share a similar 3D-structure, which has been already revealed for some of them as NK-lysin (Liepinsh et al., 1997), saposin B (Ahn et al., 2003) or amoebapore (Vorbroker et al., 1995; Hecht et al., 2004). Thus, SP-B is known as a mainly a-helical protein (40-45%), con- taining four to five amphipathic helices that allow it to interact with and perturb lipid membranes (Fig. 4). The disposition of SP-B in lipid bilayers and monolayers as (e) Re-extension into the interface upon expansion (b) (d) 2D to 3D transitions during compression ...........

(a) Model of the structure of dimeric surfactant protein SP- B according to the saposin-like folding. Potential amphipathic a-helical segments have been represented in the model of the protein as well as the location of the three intramolecular and the one intermolecular disulphide linkages (green). (b) Probable disposition of SP-B associated with surfactant bilayers and monolayers. The amphipathic helical motifs of the protein are probably located at the surface of the membranes, parallel to the plane of bilayers and monolayers. The folding of SP-B dimer probably posseses hydrophobic cavities able to stabilize lipid intermediates in the transit from bilayers to the interface.

Pérez-Gil / Chemistry and Physics of Lipids 141 (2006) 105–118 well as the effect produced on the lipids has been also analyzed by many different techniques such as 2H NMR (Morrow et al., 1993, 2004), spin resonance (Perez-Gil et al., 1995), infrared spectroscopy (Brockman et al., 2003), atomic force microscopy (Cruz et al., 2004) or epifluorescence microscopy (Cruz et al., 2000).

Phospholipid monolayers compressed to pressures into the liquid-expanded to liquid-condensed transi- tion plateau show coexistence of highly condensed domains floating in a background of less packed (liquid-expanded) lipids.
